## Concept

Our second project for our training course was to make a full front-end web app fetching APIs. Our trainer made a group of 5 and we collectively decided to use the TMBD API for our project and create for scratch this web application that is a catalogue of the different trending movies, and a catalogue of all the movies available on the API with a searchbar feature. 

This project was coded with JS Vanilla, React and Chakra UI.
