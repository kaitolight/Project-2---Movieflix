## Concept

Our second project for our training course was to make a full front-end web app fetching APIs. Our trainer made a group of 5 and we collectively decided to use the TMBD API for our project and create for scratch this web application that is a catalogue of the different trending movies, and a catalogue of all the movies available on the API with a searchbar feature. This project is, of course, fully responsive as it has always been one golden rule of our training course.

This project was coded with JS Vanilla, React and Chakra UI.
